# JSONPath reference information

JSONPath is described on [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSONPath) and was standardised as [RFC 9535](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9535). The background to the RFC is described in [JSONPath: from blog post to RFC in 17 years](https://underlap.org/jsonpath-from-blog-post-to-rfc-in-17-years) (also available on the [IETF blog](https://www.ietf.org/blog/jsonpath-rfc/))
